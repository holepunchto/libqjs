# libqjs

ABI compatible replacement for https://github.com/holepunchto/libjs built on QuickJS. Useful for embedded or otherwise restricted systems where the requirements of V8 can become problematic.

## Differences

Being built on QuickJS, the library has some differences from its V8 counterpart.

- **Strict memory management:** When using the `js_handle_scope_t` APIs, values are immediately freed when closing a scope. In V8, however, garbage collection happens at regular intervals and so values may be used for a short time even after the associated handle scope has been closed. In QuickJS, this will result in a use-after-free.

## Building

By default, the library is compiled with static QuickJS prebuilds generated by <https://github.com/holepunchto/quickjs-prebuilds>. You can bring along your own build of QuickJS by defining the `QUICKJS` and `QUICKJS_INCLUDE_DIR` variables when generating a CMake build. If you rely on the default QuickJS prebuilds, make sure to first checkout <https://github.com/holepunchto/quickjs-prebuilds> and follow the instructions on how to make a prebuild.
